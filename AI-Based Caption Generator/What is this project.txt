We'll use a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build the
caption generator.

1. Text Preprocessing: We'll start by preprocessing the input images and text data.
2. Image Features Extraction: We'll extract features from the input images using a convolutional neural
network (CNN).
3. Language Model: We'll use a language model to generate captions based on the image features and
preprocessed text data.
4. Caption Generation: We'll combine the generated caption with the extracted image features to create a final
output.

Tools and Libraries:

To build this project, we can use the following tools and libraries:

* Python as our programming language
* TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the CNN and language model
* Keras or PyTorch's nn.Module for defining the neural network architecture
* OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction
* NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing and language modeling

Step-by-Step Process:

Here's a step-by-step process to create an AI-based caption generator:

1. Collect and Preprocess Data: Collect a large dataset of images and corresponding captions. Preprocess the
data by tokenizing the text, removing special characters, and converting all text to lowercase.
2. Extract Image Features: Use a CNN to extract features from the input images. We can use a pre-trained model
like VGG16 or ResNet50 as our starting point.
3. Build Language Model: Train a language model using the preprocessed text data. We can use a Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) or a Transformer-based model.
4. Train Caption Generator: Use the extracted image features and trained language model to generate captions.
We can use a combination of sequence-to-sequence models like LSTM or GRU, or more advanced models like
transformers.
5. Test and Evaluate: Test the generated captions on a separate dataset and evaluate their quality using
metrics like BLEU score, ROUGE score, or perplexity.
